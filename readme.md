# Settings for Sublime Text 3

Settings, snippets, plugins and themes for Sublime Text. There are many like it, but this one is mine.

## Theme

The base theme is Wes Bos's `Cobalt2` with minor tweak of dark title bar (in Cobalt2.sublime-theme).

## Font

The editor font is [Operator Mono](https://www.typography.com/fonts/operator/styles/). Yes, I paid for it. It's a good font.
